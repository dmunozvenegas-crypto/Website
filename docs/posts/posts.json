Despite it’s release back in 1996 (1997 in Europe and North America), it is still actiely played by many and new world records are achieved every month.\r\nThe game consists of 16 individual tracks and world records can be achieved for the fastest single lap or the fastest completed race (three laps). Also, through the years, players discovered shortcuts in many of the tracks. Fortunately, shortcut and non-shortcut world records are listed separately.\r\nFurthermore, the Nintendo 64 was released for NTSC- and PAL-systems. On PAL-systems, the game runs a little slower. All times in this dataset are PAL-times, but they can be converted back to NTSC-times.\r\nImport data\r\n\r\n\r\n    Downloading file 1 of 2: `drivers.csv`\r\n    Downloading file 2 of 2: `records.csv`\r\n\r\nLoading the data onto objects\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLook at the data\r\n\r\nspec_tbl_df [2,334 x 9] (S3: spec_tbl_df/tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\r\n $ track          : chr [1:2334] \"Luigi Raceway\" \"Luigi Raceway\" \"Luigi Raceway\" \"Luigi Raceway\" ...\r\n $ type           : chr [1:2334] \"Three Lap\" \"Three Lap\" \"Three Lap\" \"Three Lap\" ...\r\n $ shortcut       : chr [1:2334] \"No\" \"No\" \"No\" \"No\" ...\r\n $ player         : chr [1:2334] \"Salam\" \"Booth\" \"Salam\" \"Salam\" ...\r\n $ system_played  : chr [1:2334] \"NTSC\" \"NTSC\" \"NTSC\" \"NTSC\" ...\r\n $ date           : Date[1:2334], format: \"1997-02-15\" ...\r\n $ time_period    : chr [1:2334] \"2M 12.99S\" \"2M 9.99S\" \"2M 8.99S\" \"2M 6.99S\" ...\r\n $ time           : num [1:2334] 133 130 129 127 125 ...\r\n $ record_duration: num [1:2334] 1 0 12 7 54 0 0 27 0 64 ...\r\n - attr(*, \"spec\")=\r\n  .. cols(\r\n  ..   track = col_character(),\r\n  ..   type = col_character(),\r\n  ..   shortcut = col_character(),\r\n  ..   player = col_character(),\r\n  ..   system_played = col_character(),\r\n  ..   date = col_date(format = \"\"),\r\n  ..   time_period = col_character(),\r\n  ..   time = col_double(),\r\n  ..   record_duration = col_double()\r\n  .. )\r\n\r\nVariables of interests for me are ‘time’ which is in seconds, and probably ‘time’ for the type of track and ‘shortcut’ because times will be different if the player used a shortcut. # Question to explore: which track is the fastest start by looking at a distribution of record times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bar chart shows two different peaks this can be because single and three lap tracks. we can also tell that it peaks at 45s ish. This shows that certain tracks are played more than others\r\n\r\n\r\n    Banshee Boardwalk       Bowser's Castle        Choco Mountain \r\n                   83                    69                   148 \r\nD.K.'s Jungle Parkway       Frappe Snowland       Kalimari Desert \r\n                  180                   180                   169 \r\n   Koopa Troopa Beach         Luigi Raceway         Mario Raceway \r\n                   89                   147                   160 \r\n         Moo Moo Farm          Rainbow Road         Royal Raceway \r\n                   81                   179                   149 \r\n         Sherbet Land       Toad's Turnpike         Wario Stadium \r\n                  143                   196                   201 \r\n         Yoshi Valley \r\n                  160 \r\n\r\n16- not too many.. banshee boardwalk and bowser castle don’t seem to be played much because they don’t have a lot of entries in this data set.

Data collection from a self report survey started last summer and is ongoing. The data survey contains information two type of nutrition nutrition classes. One of the type of nutrition class was single session classes, the other type of nutrition class is series based classes. These two type of nutrition classes had different questions to collect different kind of information from the participants. For one time classes the questions asked about how confident the student is in their ability to recall the knowledge and skills that the student learned in the class. Classes mostly asked about the frequency with which the student are particular foods/did specific health behaviors. The series classes also, asked about certain questions to get feedback on the content of the class to test how much did the student learned in the series classes. The data that was collected pre and post series classes only, will show is the course contributes to some changes in knowledge or health behavior. The other interesting data that was collected from both nutrition classes was demographics, food security,education, eating/nutrition knowledge and behaviors, food insecurity, and feedback on the class. This report examines the demographic of students, specifically their class standing, and the number of classes attended to see if there is a relationship between them.\r\nData Summarization\r\nFirst, I’m going examine the class standings who participated in the survey.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Freshman     Sophomore        Junior        Senior      Graduate \r\n          138            91           133           139            26 \r\nNot a student \r\n           20 \r\n\r\nBased on this data table the top three class standings that participated in this survey were Senoir at 139 participants, Freshman at 138, and Junior at 133 participants\r\nGraph displaying top 3 class standing participation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis bar graph displays the class standing of the students who participated in the survey. This graph illustrates that the top three class standing that took a part of this survey came from Freshman, Junior, Senior,the two lowest class standing that participated in this survey were Graduate, Not a Student.\r\nSecond, I am going to explore how many classes in the series students attended.\r\nThe second measure I am going to look into is about number of classes attended. The question has 1-6 choices so the participant can pick if they participate in 1 number of classes through 6 number of classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n 1  2  3  4  5  6 \r\n45 12 85 31  9  6 \r\n\r\nThis table shows that that every number of classes had more than 6 participants. Minimum is 6 participants,the participants went to only 6 classes. The number of classes that was taken the most was number 3 with a total of 85 participants saying they went to only 3 classes. The third most taken number of classes was 1 number of classes with a total of 45 participants. The average number of classes taken was 2.8.\r\nHistogram displays number of classes participants\r\nThe following histogram displays the number of participants in each number classes, from the graph it is visible that the number of classes that had the most participants was 3 number of classes. From the graph it is visible that every number of classes had at least 3 participants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] 1\r\n\r\nTable shows class standing and number of classes\r\nThe following table that compares class standing and number of classes. The table shows that graduates,and non-students had no data on the number of classes they took.\r\n\r\n               \r\n                1 2 3 4 5 6\r\n  Freshman      2 2 5 4 3 1\r\n  Sophomore     5 0 0 2 1 0\r\n  Junior        5 2 5 4 1 1\r\n  Senior        7 0 0 2 0 1\r\n  Graduate      0 0 0 0 0 0\r\n  Not a student 0 0 0 0 0 0\r\n\r\nDistribution of number of classes attended by class standing\r\nThe graph shows that their are less senior participants in number in classes, the data makes it visible that every number of classes had more than three participants from the different class standings.Sophomore had highest variability of the variable number of classes. Another insight that this graph show is the difference between freshman and senior participation. It is clear that the freshman class standing participated in all the different number of classes while senior had a gap at 2-3 number of classes. The freshman class standing overall had a greater participation compared to seniors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe average number of classes is shown below grouped by class standing. The table shows that freshman had the highest average in number of classes with 3.41, Juniors had a 2.8, sophomore had a 2.2, the lowest was seniors with a 2.1 participation average.\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 7 x 2\r\n  classstanding_order ave.classes\r\n  <fct>                     <dbl>\r\n1 Freshman                   3.41\r\n2 Sophomore                  2.25\r\n3 Junior                     2.83\r\n4 Senior                     2.1 \r\n5 Graduate                 NaN   \r\n6 Not a student            NaN   \r\n7 <NA>                       2.82\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nBased on the EDA I have conducted the one advice I have for the CHC is that may get rid of the option I have realized that one thing that CHC can do differently from the EDA information\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

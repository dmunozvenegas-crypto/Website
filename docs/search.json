I like weightlifting on my free time.I am a very outgoing individual and I like challenging my self to learn new things in life. I love my current hobby at the moment which is R Studio it is very useful in real life because you can work large amount of data and create a data analysis to find something interesting about the data. You can create websites with R studio. This actually website was made with R and with the help of the packaged called Distill which allows you to create a website without a lot of web development skills, it is easy to learn. The other code language that I am learning to is python because just like R can do a whole lot.\r\nEducation:\r\nMy major is Nutrition Food Science with an emphasize in Management. I am currently a senoir at California State University Chico. I have done many projects from product development to Nutrionatl Education classes. I have been taught the right way to perform Motivational Interviews. I have been given the opportunity to be HACCP Certified, Servsafe certified too. I have been given the opportunity to work with the CHC Data Science Team. They offered me an opportunity to Learn R language to do simple tasks like creating data, working with data to create tables, proportions. I was able to create graphs with the data this is very useful because making the data visual it makes it easier to look at the data.\r\nInternship:\r\nCHC Data Science Team, gave me the opportunity to be able to work with the Data they collected from the Project called CFHL (Cal-Fresh Healthy Living). This project collected data on classes that were given at different California University campuses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I built this website to post information about me. I built this website because I wanted to create my first website with the package called distill, using the R studio, and R language. I decide to create this website as a blog because I want to be able to post about the projects I will be working , worked on. The other reason why I created this website was to show that I am starting to learn the language R. By building this website I have taught myself lots of new things, how to trouble shoot, fix the problem.

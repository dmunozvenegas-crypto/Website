# 2. Sword Art Online

    Genre: Animation, Action, Adventure

  The battle for survival in this MMORPG gave SAO a very solid plot, at least for the first half of the series. Character motives and relationships were clear and each interaction created a different perspective of the lead character Kirito. His partner Asuna also displayed a strength not usually seen in female anime characters. But as soon as the second arc of this light novel adaptation began, the story and its characters begun to crumble. Asuna was cast to the sideline as a princess that needed saving and Kirito was “trapped” within the virtual world unable to face reality yet without Asuna.

Despite its weaknesses, SAO’s breathtaking scenery and fluid animation cannot be ignored. The first opening song, Crossing Field by Lisa, was a very memorable piece fit for the series. If not for the flaws of the second half of the series, SAO would have ranked better this year.

![](Kuroko Basketball.jpg){width=50}

# 3.Kurokos's Basketball

    Genre: Animation, Comedy, Sport

  I was never a fan of sports anime but Kuroko no Basket is such an enjoyable watch I could not afford to miss it! More than the basketball which I came to love because of this series, the character interactions – their teamwork, and all the moments in between felt real. So was the fact that no matter how hard we work on achieving something, we cannot always win. Let’s not forget how our lead characters can be such eye candies and even though the voice cast are not all well-known, they have done a great job of bringing to life each character.
